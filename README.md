## Introduction

Eat-Da-Burger is a simple application that allows users to add burger entries and sort them into two categories: *To Devour* and *Devoured*. Users can also remove burgers from either category.

## Technologies
- Frontend - [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/ "Handlebars Docs") / [JQuery](https://jquery.com/ "JQuery Docs")
- Routing - [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/ "Express Docs")
- Backend / Server - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node Docs")
- Database - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/ "MySQL Docs") / [Sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/ "Sequelize Docs")

## Learning Objectives

- Use all known CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the same program to create a new burger, get previously created burgers from the SQL database, update burger status from *To Devour* to *Devoured*, and delete entries
- Use jQuery AJAX to structure data fed to backend with appropriate method and route handling
- Study associations between `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods via frontend AJAX requests and their corresponding *Sequelize* `findAll`, `create`, `update` and `destroy` in backend handling.
- Gain comfort with `sequelize-cli` npm package in order to initialize `/models` and `/config` folders and improve workflow.
- Develop MVC structured application
- Practiced deploying application to *Heroku* and establishing remote JAWS DB
